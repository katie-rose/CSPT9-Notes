## Defining A Class

A human being is a class. A baby is an object.
A car has design specs, that is a class. The car is the object.

You define the class and then use it.

## Methods in Classes

- Define a method in a class by including function definitions within the scope of the class block.
- There must be a special first argument `self` in all of method definitions which gets bound to the calling insrance.
- There is usually a special method called `__init__` in most classes.

## Simple Class Definition

```python
class student:
    def __init__(self,n,a):
        self.full_name = n
        self.age = a
    def get_age(self):
        return self.age
```
