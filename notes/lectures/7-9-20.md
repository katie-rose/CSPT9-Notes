## Scopes

When you use a variable in a function, it's local in scope to the function.

```python
x = 12

def changeX():
    global x
    x = 99

changeX()

# This prints 12. What do we have to modify in change_x() to get it to print 99?
print(x)
```

We want the x in this scope to mirror the global scope.

**Definitions**

In Python, we can remember the scope rules using the LEGB acronym.

Local
Enclosing
Global
Builtin

- Local
  The Local scope will always be searched first and includes any variables assigned within a function.

```python
  >>> x = 1
>>> y = 2
>>> def my_function(x):
...     y = 3
...     print(x, y)
...
>>> my_function(10)
10 3
>>> print(x, y)
1 2
>>>
```

For the `print` function call within `my_function`, the `x` defined as the function parameter will be found first. Also, the definition for `y` on line 4 will be found first.

For the `print` function call made outside of `my_function`, there is no Local scope, only Global scope.

- Enclosing
  - Python allows functions to be nested. When searching for a variable, Python starts by looking in Local, and then searches the Enclosing scope.

```python
>>> x = 100
>>> def my_outer_function(x):
...     y = 50
...     def my_inner_function():
...         print(x, y)
...     my_inner_function()
...
>>> my_outer_function(75)
75 50
>>>
```

For the `print` function call on line 5 inside `my_inner_function`, to find `x`, it will first search `my_inner_function` and then `my_outer_function` where the parameter is defined. To find y on line 5, it will first search `my_inner_function`, then `my_outer_function` where it will find the definition on line 3.

- Global
  - Global scope is search after Local and Enclosing. Global is the simplest to understand. A variable declared at the global level is not enclosed inside any function.

```python
>>> x = 10
>>> print(x)
10
>>>
```

One thing to remember is that in Python a variable must be defined before it is referenced.

```python
>>> print(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

- Builtin
  - If a variable is not found in Local, Enclosing, or Global scope, then the builtin variables are searched.

```python
>>> pow(2, 3)
8
>>> __name__
'__main__'
>>> len('cat')
3
```

You can see above, how even though `pow`, `__name__` and `len` were not defined in the program, no errors were thrown. That is because these are found in the Builtin scope.

You can find all builtin variables by typing `dir(__builtins__):`

## File I/O

```python
# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# YOUR CODE HERE
# fp stands for file pointer
with open('src/foo.txt') as fp:
    for line in fp:
        print(line)

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
bar = open('src/bar.txt', 'w')
bar.write('Am I tired? \n Yes, very. \n Lets keep going')
```

## Class vs. Instance

Class = blueprint.

Instance = the actual building.
