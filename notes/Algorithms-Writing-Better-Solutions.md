# Algorithms - Writing Better Solutions

The Reflect step of UPER may be the most critical step of all.

During this step, you look deeply at your solution and ask yourself questions about the solution. Eventually, you must decide whether your solution is “good enough” or if you should continue iterating on the problem to improve your solution. How do you make that decision? How does a skilled problem-solver and programmer go about deciding and then justifying a decision about when a solution is “good enough”?

## Things to Be Looking At

During this step, it’s helpful to have categories in mind for the questions you ask and the actions you take. The main categories you look at are:

1. Performance

- What is the runtime and space complexity of your solution?
- Is that an acceptable level of performance for the size of inputs that you can expect?
- Is your input size constrained in a way that makes runtime complexity less critical?

2. Readability & Cleanliness

- Now that you’ve solved the problem one way, can you think of other ways to solve the problem?
- Are any of the other ways shorter, more readable, or less complicated than the first way that you did it?
- How readable is your solution? Can you change variable names, function names, or code structure to improve readability?
- Are there any redundancies or unused code that you can remove? How DRY is your code?

3. Edge Cases

- Test your solution and verify that it solves the problem for both the main case and any edge cases.
- Document any edge cases that are not covered by your solution and explain why they were not solved.

4. Time Constraints

- Do you have more time to improve this solution, or would you spend your time better by moving on to the next problem you are trying to solve?
- Did you document anything that you did “hackily” because of time constraints?
- Include why you couldn’t do it the “Right Way” and what you would need to do to make it “Right”.

5. Documentation

- Have you included adequate comments and documentation that will assist other programmers and your future self in easily using this code?
- Have you documented the changes that you need to make in the future, so you don’t forget?
- Have you documented the things that work for now, but you need to address in the future?

6. Making Connections

- Does this problem and solution remind you of any other problems that you’ve worked on or already solved? How are they similar or different?
- Can you make any connections between this problem and something that you will do or have done in the “real-world”?
- Can your solution also work for other problems that you are working on or have completed?

7. Process

- How would you rate your problem-solving process?
- What would you do differently next time? What went right?-
- What went wrong?
